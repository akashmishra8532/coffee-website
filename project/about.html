                <h3>what makes our coffee special?</h3>
                <p>The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) defines specialty coffee as coffee that has been graded above 80.
                 This means that the quality of the coffee is beyond the final product served on your cup. Specialty coffee is a novel approach to coffee
                that is driven by morally conscious ethics, an appreciation for quality and variety, and a thriving community that spans the globe.</p>
                <p>The beans should then be delivered swiftly to the mill to preserve the freshness and potential of the coffee beans.
                 The beans should then be carefully processed and special attention should be given to ensure that the bean is not dried unevenly,
                insufficiently, too slowly, or too quickly, as this will reduce its chances of being graded special.</p>
